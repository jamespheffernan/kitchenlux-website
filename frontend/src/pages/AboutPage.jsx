              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>KitchenLux was born from a simple frustration experienced by our founders, Michael and Sarah Chen, during a vacation rental stay in Napa Valley in 2023. Having planned an elaborate dinner to celebrate their anniversary, they were dismayed to find the kitchen equipped with dull knives, scratched pans, and inadequate tools.</p>
              <p>As passionate home cooks, they believed that a memorable vacation shouldn't mean compromising on cooking quality. They envisioned a service that would deliver premium kitchenware to vacation rentals, allowing travelers to cook with the same quality tools they enjoyed at home.</p>
              <p>What began as a small operation in San Francisco has quickly expanded to serve major vacation destinations across the country. Our mission is to enhance the vacation rental experience by providing chef-quality kitchen tools that inspire culinary creativity and bring joy to cooking, no matter where you are.</p>

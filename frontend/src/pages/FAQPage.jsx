                <p>Hygiene is our top priority. Every item undergoes a rigorous multi-stage cleaning and sanitization process between rentals:</p>

              <div className="faq-answer">
                <p>Our standard rental includes basic coverage for normal wear and tear. We understand accidents happen in the kitchen. If something breaks:</p>

                  <li>Notify us through our website or by calling customer service</li>

                  <li>Without Premium Damage Protection, responsibility is determined case-by-case, though we're generally understanding about normal kitchen accidents</li>
